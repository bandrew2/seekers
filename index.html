	<p>Electromagnetic energy is composed of fundamental particles called photons (or quanta) that have characteristics of both particles and waves.  Photons are discrete packets of 
	energy that make up the entire EMS spectrum where energy levels depend on the wave frequency. Low-energy photons make up radio waves, 
	while high-energy photons make up X-rays and gamma-rays. A specific energy level also defines each class type of EMS. </p>
	
	<p>A correlation exists between the energy of a photon and its wave frequency. The following equation also holds true for all electromagnetic waves: </p>

	E = <em>h</em> x <em>f</em> &emsp; 6.6260715 x 10<sup>-34</sup> x 545,077,196 x 10<sup>6</sup> = 3.612 x 10<sup>-19</sup> Joules</p>

	<p><div class="light-description"><span style='color: #00ef8f;'><div class="center">Radio Frequency  (&#x3BB;) = 100 m</div>
	Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation created by an alternating current (AC) that moves through a conductor (wires or antennas) 
	that generates an electromagnetic field (EM). The EM field is a combination of an electric field and a magnetic field that oscillate while 
	traveling at the speed of light. In the EMS spectrum, radio frequency waves, also called RF, have the lowest frequencies and longest wavelengths.
	</span>	</div></p>
<br>
	<div class="light-description">
	<span style='color: #99ffeb;'><p> <div class="center">Microwave (&#x3BB;) = 10 mm</div>		
	Microwaves occupy a region of EMR with wavelengths ranging from 1 mm to 1 meter making them 
	short-wavelength radio waves.  Microwave ovens radiate at a frequency of 2.45 GHz, with (&#x3BB;) = 122 mm, creating heat from 
	molecular friction via a transfer of energy.  The wave properties of microwaves make them well suited for use in satellite 
	communication and radar systems.</span></p>
<br>
	<span style='color:Red;'><p> <div class="center">Infrared (&#x3BB;) = 10 &#x3BC;m</div>		
	The invisible infrared region covers wavelengths from 700 nm up to 1 mm. IR is also known as thermal radiation and is
	naturally produced by solar radiation and fire.  Every object, both hot and cold, gives off heat in the form of IR.  IR has a 
	lower energy level and a longer wavelength than the EMR that produces visible light.</p> </span></p>
<br>
	<span style='color:#00ef8f;'><p> <div class="center">Visible Light (&#x3BB;) = 550 nm</div>		
	The visible light spectrum is a very narrow band of the electromagnetic spectrum. Visible light is comprised 
	of the colors of the rainbow: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. Different wavelengths correspond to the 
	different colors, with red having the longest wavelength and violet the shortest. Our eyes detect this specific range of wavelengths that 
	the brain interprets as colors.  When combined together the visible wavelengths appear as white light.</span> </p>
<br>

	<span style='color:#BF40BF;'><p> <div class="center">Ultraviolet (&#x3BB;) = 100 nm</div>The invisible 
	ultraviolet region covers wavelengths from 400 nm down to 10 nm. The sun is the major source 
	of UV radiation that is known for it's harmful UV-B and UV-C sub-regions that are mostly absorbed by the earth's atmosphere.
	UV has a higher energy level and a shorter wavelength than the EMR that produces visible light.</span> </p>
<br>	
	<span style='color:#ff9999;'><p> <div class="center">X-rays (&#x3BB;) = 1 nm </div>X-rays (&#967;) are high-energy 
	electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths between 0.01 nm and 10 nm and are 
	generated when inner-shell electrons transition between energy levels.  Both X-rays and light waves transport energy as waves and photons.  
	Their short wavelengths allow them to pass through less dense materials but not through dense materials such as bone.  
	X-rays are a high energy form of ionizing radiation, meaning they can damage living tissue.</span></p>
<br>
	<span style='color:#99ffeb;'><p> <div class="center">Gamma rays (&#x3BB;) = 1x10<sup>-6</sup> nm </div>		
	Gamma rays (γ) are the highest-energy form of EMR and originate from the nucleus of an atom.  
	Gamma rays have the smallest wavelengths and are classified as both a wave, and photons that travel as mass-less packets of 
	pure energy.  They are produced by nuclear processes like radioactive decay and supernova explosions. They are highly penetrating, able to pass 
	through dense materials like lead, and can cause damage to living tissue by ionizing atoms.</span></p>
